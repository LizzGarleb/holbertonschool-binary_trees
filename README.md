</h4>

Welcome to the Holberton School Binary Trees repository! This repository contains code examples and projects related to binary trees, an important topic for data structures and algorithms.

## About Holberton School
Holberton School is a project-based alternative to college for the next generation of software engineers. The curriculum focuses on full-stack software engineering and covers web development, low-level programming, DevOps, and more.

## About Binary Trees
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children. Binary trees are often used in computer science to represent hierarchical structures such as file systems, parse trees, and decision trees.

Thanks you for visiting the Holberton School Low Level Programming repository! Hope that the code example demonstrates in this repository will be helpful in your software engineering journey.
